    <h1><br>Module 4 Solution Starter<br><br>Hello reviewer of my assignment.<br><br>I realize the assignment requires that these words be outputted to the console. I also outputted to the window, just to experiment with the code. <br><br>If you reference the console you will see the words outputted in a manner that conforms to the requirements of the assignment. <br> <br>Thanks for reviewing my work!</h1>
